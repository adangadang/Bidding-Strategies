# COMPGW02 Web Economics - Real-Time-Bidding (RTB) on the iPinYou dataset
This repository contains the source code, group and individual reports for the Group Project of "COMPGW02 Web Economics" course for UCL's MSc in Business Analytics (academic year 2017-2018).

## Description
In this project, we worked on an online advertising problem. We helped advertisers to form a bidding strategy in order to place their ads online in a real-
time bidding (RTB) system. RTB mechanism to buy and sell ads is the most significant evolution in recent years in display and mobile advertising.  
RTB essentially facilitates buying an individual ad impression in real time, automatically triggered by a user's visit.
Although other types of auctions, such as the first price auction, are also popular, RTB exchanges typically employ the second price auction model.
